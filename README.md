# Weather-Quill

## Transforming Weather Data into Poetic Narratives

Weather-Quill is a Python application that fetches weather data and transforms it into creative, theatrical narratives using AI language models. It turns mundane weather reports into engaging stories by personifying meteorological elements - clouds become characters, winds act as directors, and temperature shifts transform into plot twists.

## üé≠ Sample Outputs

### Dramatic Style (OpenAI)

```
ACT I: THE MORNING UNVEILED

The stage is set in London, where the atmospheric drama unfolds beneath a canvas of scattered clouds. 
The temperature, a gentle 18¬∞C, plays the protagonist, moving through the city with a flourish that 
feels distinctly warmer at 20¬∞C to those who encounter it. 

Humidity, that ever-present supporting character, lingers at 72% ‚Äì not quite the star of today's 
performance, but certainly making its presence known in every breath, every scene.

The wind enters stage left, a modest player at 3.5 m/s, carrying whispers from the Southwest. 
It's neither the boisterous villain nor the silent extra, but rather the messenger, delivering 
the script to cloudiness, which occupies just 40% of the grand theater overhead.

```

### Shakespearean Style (Claude)

```
What light through yonder atmosphere breaks?
'Tis Paris, and fair Sol is the radiant dawn!
At fifteen degrees, the air's embrace awakes,
While summer's lease doth hold 'til day is gone.

From southward winds at gentle pace do blow,
Like whispers from a distant lover's sigh;
The clouds, like scattered thoughts, do come and go,
Claiming but half their kingdom in the sky.

[...continues]
```

## üåê Language Model Support

Weather-Quill supports two major language model providers, each with different capabilities:

### OpenAI GPT
- Available models: gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4o
- Strengths: Wide availability, consistent outputs
- Set up: Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

### Anthropic Claude
- Available models: claude-3-opus-20240229, claude-3-sonnet-20240229, claude-3-haiku-20240307, claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Missing API Keys
```
Error: OpenWeatherMap API key is not set. Please set the OPENWEATHER_API_KEY environment variable.
Error: At least one LLM provider API key (OpenAI or Anthropic) must be set.
```
Solution: Ensure you've set the required API keys as environment variables.

### City Not Found
```
Error: City not found. Please check the spelling or try another city.
```
Solution: Verify the city name or try adding the country code (e.g., "London,UK").

### Rate Limit Exceeded
```
Error: API request failed: Rate limit exceeded
```
Solution: Wait until your API rate limit resets or switch to a different provider.

### Language Model Issues
```
Error: Failed to initialize LLM provider: claude
```
Solution: Verify you have the correct API key for the requested model provider.
